<article> - element represents a self-contained composition in a document,
page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently 
distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: 
a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

<address> - element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact 
information for a person or people, or for an organization.

<section>

<p>

<div>

<span> - element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does
not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements
for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because
they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only 
when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much 
like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a 
<span> is an inline element.

<img>

<aside> - element represents a portion of a document whose content is 
only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are 
frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

<audio> - element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain 
one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or 
the <source> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one.

<source> - element specifies multiple media resources for the <picture>, the
<audio> element, or the <video> element. It is an empty element, 
meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It 
is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file 
formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers 
given their differing support for image file formats and media file 
formats.

<canvas> - element with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to
draw graphics and animations.

<datalist> - element contains a set of <option> elements that represent the 
permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls.

<details> - creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when
the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label can be provided using
the <summary> element.

<summary> -  element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a <details> element's
 disclosure box. Clicking the <summary> element toggles the state of the parent
 <details> element open and closed.

<embed> - element embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This 
content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content 
such as a browser plug-in.

<nav>

<output> - is a container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a 
calculation or the outcome of a user action.

<progress> - element displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, 
typically displayed as a progress bar.
